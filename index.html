                <p>We can’t thank you enough for your love and support while we start this new chapter in our lives! As I’m sure most of you know, we’ve decided to take the road less traveled and have a small intimate ceremony with our closest family. With that being said, we will be hosting a large Jack and Jill Wedding shower to celebrate with everyone we hold dear! This website was also created as a way to make sure everyone that can’t attend the actual ceremony can still celebrate with us. We hope you understand why we made this choice and while we regret that everyone we love won’t be able to attend our ceremony, we do hope that you join us for our celebration prior to the wedding! You’ll find the RSVP below if you want to attend and we can send an update once we have a set date and location!</p>

                    Paul and I continuously just missed each other. We went to high school together, ran in the same circles, had similar friends, worked at Kings Island and then the same Kroger as teenagers and even lived on the same street. It was like we were escape artists, and we were running from each other. The closest thing to an interaction we had was him pulling out a very interesting dash ornament when I inquired about it in a dark Kroger parking lot after a miserable summer shift. That was the summer before I cut my hair, ran off to Athens and did everything other than change my name, and we were out of each other's minds. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple speed bumps with college, a move back home and more than a few bad boyfriends later, Paul and I matched on a dating app. I was terrified. So terrified I opened with a very goofy GIF rather than my normally charming greetings. A few months after, I was in an awful car accident, and Paul’s timing was just as bad as it always was. The first time he asked me out I was covered in bruises and embarrassed, the second time I was on a LOT of pain medication in Bethesda North Hospital, an impeccably timed gallbladder surgery, and the third and final time I couldn’t drive because of the pain medication from the impeccably timed gallbladder surgery. During that very stressful time, I made the mistake of not saying the words “but maybe another time” attached to my “I would, but I can’t”, a detail Paul will never let me forget. Three strikes and I was out, our texts started slowing to a stop and just like that we had missed each other again. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A summer, a boyfriend and a breakup later, I was single and celebrating my best friend’s birthday. Paul and I matched on yet another dating website and I was annoyed to say the least. Still confused on why he stopped talking to me, and egged on by my friends, I confronted him with a very assertive message inquiring why he ignored me? Wasn’t I a charming conversationalist? He informed me of the confusion on his end, his assumption of my disinterest, and we were happily chatting away again. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a month of pleasant conversation, I was impatient for him to ask me out, and he was wary of doing the asking, seeing as I had already turned him down three times. Finally, another night with my best friend’s encouragement and a glass of wine was all it took for me to muster up the courage to ask him out. It was a very clumsy, borderline mean “Are we going to keep texting for the rest of our lives or are we going to hang out?” type of message, but I had done it nonetheless. A week later, my palms were sweating as I waited for him to pick me up. We had decided on Kings Island’s Halloween Haunt, a call back to our high school days. I was so nervous we wouldn’t like each other, or that the conversation would be dull. After the first three minutes in the car, Paul hooked me in, or it might have been his impeccably curated playlist and the vanilla air freshener he bought especially for our date. We stayed until the park closed, and even after that I didn’t want the date to end. In case you were unaware, my future husband is a very entertaining and charming date. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each date he took me on was more thoughtful than the last. He took me to Young's Dairy on our second date and didn’t bat an eye when I cried at how beautiful the Jersey dairy cows were, or babbled so much that we got lost in a corn maze. I’m not the most graceful human being, but Paul always made me feel like a Hallmark movie, especially corny but sweet nonetheless. 
                    I knew I wanted to marry Paul from that date. He had charmed everyone, even my mom, who is hardly too impressed with anyone. I loved him, but he took a bit more convincing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continuously whispered that I loved him when I thought he couldn’t hear me. News flash, he could. I think growing up in a household with the volume at a constant yell has damaged my hearing. The first time I told him I loved him, he looked at me point blank and said “Why would you say that?” I cried. But we got through it, I charmed him eventually, and we had two blissful years together. Two years of laughing, clumsy fun and stories to tell. Paul always worked hard to keep a smile on my face. His favorite thing to do is take me to do things I had never gotten to before. That’s what landed us in Disney on our second anniversary.

                    I really love taking Avery places she’s never been. I love to see her eyes light up and her happiness gives me so much joy. I couldn’t wait to take Avery to Disney and I wanted to make it the greatest week of her life. I knew I didn’t want to pop the question at Disney, (While Avery loves a good Disney movie, she isn’t a “Disney Girl”).The ring I picked out for Avery was floral themed, so after some research I found Harry P. Leu Botanical Gardens. From the pictures, it was stunning. I knew how important preserving this moment was for the both of us, so hiring photographers to capture her reaction was top priority. Laz and Andrea, our photographers helped me set everything up while I sent Avery to the spa. I gave Avery the address (I’m still not entirely convinced she didn’t google it in the car) and met her Uber at the entrance to the gardens. Surprisingly, I have never been less nervous for anything in my entire life, with Avery there was no question. I was just going to let her meander around the gardens until she stumbled across the spot I had picked out, but it was like she had a waterfall radar. She turned her back to take a picture and when she turned back around I was on my knee. She clumsily accepted my proposal, and we got to take photos of our first moments as an engaged couple. Fun Fact: The reason we’re smiling and giggling in engagement our photos is because we decided to have Pollo Tropical for lunch.
